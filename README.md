This repository contains the function algorithms created by Corbyn Berg for the mech 105 class spring 2-18. The repository contains this readme file on the homepage to go along with a folder named "Matlab homeworks". Inside "Matlab homeworks" there are 3 more folders, each containing the algorithm the folder's named after, as well as a readme file to breifly explain the algorithm.
## Matlab Homeworks
The folder on the homepage for the repository, containing all the other folders. Just a basic folder to hold the algorithms.
